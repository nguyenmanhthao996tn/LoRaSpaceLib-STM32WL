# LoRaSpaceLib for RAK3172 (STM32WL)

<img src="docs/rak3172.jpg" width="600">

This reposistory aim to deploy the LoRaSpaceLib on [RAK3172](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisduo-lpwan-module-rak3172) (STM32WLE55CCUx) using [STM32duino Core](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32).

# Installation

## Requirement
  - [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (It's highly recommended to use the **Legacy IDE Version** *at least version v1.6.8*)
  - [stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32)
  - A device with [RAK3172](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisduo-lpwan-module-rak3172) integrated

## Setup Guide
  1. Download this reposistory as ZIP

# FAQ

### <u>Is this library Low-power</u>?

**No**, the library currently using polling for reading IRQ. Radio Interrupts & sleep function will be implemented later.

### <u>What is the default syncword for LR-FHSS packets</u>?

It's ```2C 0F 79 95```.

```
const uint8_t lr_fhss_sync_word[4] = {0x2C, 0x0F, 0x79, 0x95};
```

### <u>Can this library communicate with LoRaWAN Satellites</u>?

Technically, **Yes if you send LR-FHSS packets in the approriate format & configuration**. However, communicating between devices on Earth and Satellites is quite challenging and required some special aspects. I would recommended you to contact Lacuna Space for accessing of their LoRaWAN Satellites and RFThings for antennas/RF advises.
